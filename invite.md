Dear {name},

I'd like to invite {package} to join the r-lib organisation. The r-lib organisation is a collection of fundamental infrastructure packages like R6, xml2, fs, and testthat. We'd like to invite {package} to join because we see it as a piece of important infrastructure for the R community.

There are two aspects to this invitation:

1. We think your package is great and we'd love to help promote it.

2. We think your package is sufficiently important that if you ever
   lost interest, we would step in and take over maintenance. (This
   would only happen with your explicit consent.)

If you're interested, please let me know and I can invite you to join the r-lib organisation, and then you can transfer the repo in.

Hadley
